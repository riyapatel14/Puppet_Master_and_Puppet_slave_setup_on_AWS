```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following line:

```
<Puppet_Master_Private_IP> puppet

sudo systemctl start puppetserver.service
```

### Verify the version of Puppet Master

```
sudo systemctl status puppetserver.service
```

## Puppet Agent Setup

### Modify the Puppet Agent's hosts file

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following line:

```
<Puppet_Master_Private_IP> puppet
```

### Download and install the Puppet Agent packages

```
curl -O https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet6-release-bionic.deb
```
```
sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb
```
```

```
sudo apt-get install puppet-agent -y
```

### Enable and restart the Puppet Agent service

## Signing Certificates on the Puppet Master

## Applying Manifests on Puppet master

### Create a Puppet manifest file

```
sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
```

Add content like the following example:

```
file { '/tmp/puppet_test.txt':
  ensure => present,
  mode   => '0644',
  content => "Hello from Puppet master (Welcome to puppet testing with vishal.) to agent on IP address ${ipaddress_eth0}\n",
}
```

### Trigger Puppet Agent to apply the changes (run on puppet Agent)

```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
```

### Check the content of the test file (run on puppet Agent)

```
sudo cat /tmp/puppet_test.txt

```
